# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we focused on analyzing code coverage to assess the effectiveness of our unit tests in JFreeChart. The objective was to measure different types of coverage, including statement coverage, branch coverage, and condition coverage, to ensure that our test cases exercised as much of the code as possible. By utilizing tools such as EclEmma for Java, we identified untested parts of the code and refined our test suite to maximize coverage. This report details our approach, findings, and lessons learned from conducting a thorough code coverage analysis.

### **Step 3: DU-Pair Coverage Calculation**

Using the formula:

DU-Pair Coverage=DU-pairs covered/Total DU-pairs×100%


#### **For calculateColumnTotal()**



* **Total DU-Pairs** = 3
* **DU-Pairs Covered** = 2 (since n: 7 → 8 is missed in two tests)
* **Coverage**: 2/3×100=66.67%


#### **For getCentralValue()**



* **Total DU-Pairs** = 2
* **DU-Pairs Covered** = 2
* **Coverage**: 2/2×100=100%

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

To ensure comprehensive testing, we utilized EclEmma for code coverage analysis. Among the three standard coverage metrics—statement coverage, branch coverage, and condition coverage—we identified that only branch coverage was fully supported by our testing environment. As a result, we adjusted our approach by focusing on method coverage and line coverage in place of statement and condition coverage.

To improve overall test effectiveness, we systematically analyzed uncovered portions of the code and designed additional test cases to target them. Our strategy included:
Identifying unreachable branches: Some conditional branches were not exercised in existing test cases, leading to gaps in branch coverage. We introduced new tests specifically designed to execute these paths.
Testing exception handling paths: Certain edge cases, such as invalid input values and error-prone operations, were not adequately covered. We incorporated test cases to validate proper exception handling and error propagation.
Focusing on overlooked edge cases: We identified scenarios where boundary values, null inputs, or extreme cases were not sufficiently tested. Additional test cases were written to ensure the robustness of the implementation.
One concrete example of our testing improvements was in the Range.shift(Range base, double delta, boolean allowZeroCrossing) method. This method adjusts a given numerical range based on a shift value (delta) and determines whether crossing zero is permitted (allowZeroCrossing).
Key Testing Gaps Identified:
The conditional logic controlling zero-crossing behavior was not fully exercised, leaving certain branches untested.
Scenarios where allowZeroCrossing is false and delta causes a boundary shift that would otherwise cross zero were not adequately validated.
The handling of edge values (e.g., shifting a range from positive to negative bounds) lacked sufficient test coverage.

Newly Introduced Test Cases:
Explicitly triggering the zero-crossing logic: We designed tests where shifting the range would attempt to cross zero, both with allowZeroCrossing = true and allowZeroCrossing = false, ensuring expected behavior.
Boundary condition tests: We added cases where the range is near zero, and shifting would just touch zero without crossing, confirming correct handling of limits.
Negative and positive delta values: We included test cases where delta is both positive and negative to verify consistent behavior across different shifting directions.
By incorporating these additional test cases, we significantly improved branch and line coverage, reducing untested paths and increasing the reliability of our test suite.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

# Pros of EclEmma (JaCoCo)

- Provides easy-to-read visual feedback on covered and uncovered code.
- Integrates well with Eclipse for seamless testing and analysis.
- Supports multiple coverage types, including statement and branch coverage.

# Cons of EclEmma (JaCoCo)

- Does not track path coverage, making it harder to analyze complex conditionals.
- External dependencies can make some branches difficult to test.

# Metrics Reported

- **Statement Coverage:** Measures the percentage of executed statements in the code.
- **Branch Coverage:** Evaluates the execution of all possible branches in conditional statements.
- **Condition Coverage:** Ensures that each Boolean sub-expression evaluates to both true and false at least once.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

| Approach             | Advantages                                                                                           | Disadvantages                                                                        |

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

Throughout this lab, we encountered several challenges and learned important lessons:

- **Handling Complex Conditionals:**  
  Some methods had deeply nested conditionals, making it difficult to achieve full branch coverage. Breaking these conditions into separate, well-documented cases improved our testing approach.

- **Interpreting Coverage Reports:**  
  Understanding why certain branches were not covered required careful debugging and analysis, reinforcing the importance of reviewing test execution paths in detail.

- **Balancing Coverage and Redundancy:**  
  While maximizing coverage was our goal, it was also essential to ensure that our tests were meaningful and not merely increasing coverage without adding value.

- **Limited Access to Implementation Details:**  
  Testing a third-party library meant that certain internal behaviors were difficult to analyze. Additional documentation or sample outputs could aid in designing more precise test cases.

**Key Takeaway:**  
This lab reinforced the importance of code coverage as a quality metric in software testing. While achieving 100% coverage is not always practical, strategically identifying and addressing coverage gaps significantly improves test reliability.
# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab had easy-to-follow instructions and was easy to understand, as we got to directly apply and build on what we learned in the previous lab. It was interesting to see the side-by-side comparisons.

This lab and lab report were completed with the aid of AI, which helped us be more efficient in our workflows and supplemented our learning greatly.
