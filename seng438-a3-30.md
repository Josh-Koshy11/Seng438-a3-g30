# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we focused on analyzing code coverage to assess the effectiveness of our unit tests in JFreeChart. The objective was to measure different types of coverage, including statement coverage, branch coverage, and condition coverage, to ensure that our test cases exercised as much of the code as possible. By utilizing tools such as EclEmma for Java, we identified untested parts of the code and refined our test suite to maximize coverage. This report details our approach, findings, and lessons learned from conducting a thorough code coverage analysis.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

Before making any modifications, we ran our existing unit tests and recorded the initial coverage metrics for statement, branch, and condition coverage. This baseline helped us identify gaps where our tests were not covering all possible execution paths.

Using the coverage report generated by EclEmma, we examined the uncovered lines and branches to determine potential reasons for gaps in test coverage. Some methods had conditional logic that was not fully exercised, while others had error-handling cases that were not triggered by our initial tests.


# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

We used EclEmma and out of statement, branch, and condition coverage, only branch coverage was supported. We decided to replace statement and condition coverage with method and line coverage.
To improve overall coverage, we added new test cases targeting uncovered code, focusing on unreachable branches in conditional statements, exception handling paths, and edge cases that were previously overlooked

For example, in the Range.shift(Range base, double delta, boolean allowZeroCrossing) method, we observed that certain branches controlling the zero-crossing behavior were not covered. We introduced test cases specifically designed to trigger these conditions.
